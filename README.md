# alchemist

Alchemist aims to be a nutrition label/nutrition facts generator utilizing the USDA's Food Composition Database.

Planned features for Alchemist include:
* Multiple nutrition facts table layouts
* Ingredient lists
* Recipes as ingredients in other recipes
* Recipe saving and editing

Alchemist currently needs work in these areas (and quite possibly more):
* UX/UI design
* Input sanitation/control and error handling 
* Testing, lots of testing

You'll need [npm](https://npmjs.com) installed. From the command line after cloning the repository:

```bash
# cd into the folder:

# Install dependencies:
